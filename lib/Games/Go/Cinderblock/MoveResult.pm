=head1 NAME

Games::Go::Cinderblock::MoveResult

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This results from evaluate_move.

It has a L</delta>, which describes changes to the board

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 rulemap 

=head2 succeeded

0 if move failed, 1 if move succeeded.

=head2 reason

If failed, this is why. e.g. 'suicide', 'collosion'

=head2 basis_state

=head2 resulting_state

=head2 delta

L</resulting_state> minus L</basis_state>, essentially.

A delta is an object that describes changes between 2 states with
the same rulemap.
